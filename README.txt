This project was created in December 2023 with Alice and Folayemi

I wish to expand on this so that the game cycle asks for input.

Since the project, I've added ASCII art and some extra features

I want to implement extra pokemon stats e.g. attack, def

I tried to do type matchup but that seems like it would be more complicated

I think perhaps a leaderboard creation using csv files wouldn't be too difficult to add either
